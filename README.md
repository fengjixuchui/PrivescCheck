# PrivescCheck

This script aims to __enumerate common Windows security misconfigurations__ which can be leveraged for privilege escalation and __gather various information__ which might be useful for __exploitation__ and/or __post-exploitation__.

I built on the amazing work done by [@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y) and [@mattifestation](https://twitter.com/mattifestation) in [PowerUp](https://github.com/HarmJ0y/PowerUp). I added more checks and also tried to reduce the amount of false positives.


## Usage 

By default, the script runs only "quick-win" checks. To get extra information, use the option `-Extended`.

From a PowerShell prompt:
```
PS C:\Temp\> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope process -Force
PS C:\Temp\> . .\PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck 
PS C:\Temp\> . .\PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck -Extended
```

From a PowerShell prompt + Log results to a file:
```
PS C:\Temp\> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope process -Force
PS C:\Temp\> . .\PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck | Tee-Object "result.txt"
PS C:\Temp\> . .\PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck -Extended | Tee-Object "result.txt"
```

From a command prompt + Log results to a file:
```
C:\Temp\>powershell -ep bypass -c ". .\PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck | Tee-Object result.txt"
C:\Temp\>powershell -ep bypass -c ". .\PrivescCheck.ps1; Invoke-PrivescCheck -Extended | Tee-Object result.txt"
```


## Yet another Windows Privilege escalation tool, why?

I really like [PowerUp](https://github.com/HarmJ0y/PowerUp) because it can enumerate common vulnerabilities very quickly and without using any third-party tools. The problem is that it hasn't been updated for several years now. The other issue I spotted quite a few times over the years is that it sometimes returns false positives which are quite confusing.

Other tools exist on GitHub but they are __not as complete__ or they have __too many dependencies__. For example, they rely on WMI calls or other command outputs.

Therefore, I decided to make my own script with the following constraints in mind:

- __It must not use third-party tools__ such as `accesschk.exe` from SysInternals.

- __It must not use built-in Windows commands__ such as `whoami.exe` or `netstat.exe`. The reason for this is that I want my script to be able to run in environments where AppLocker (or any other Application Whitelisting solution) is enforced.

- __It must not use built-in Windows tools__ such as `sc.exe` or `tasklist.exe` because you'll often get an __Access denied__ error if you try to use them from WinRM for example.

- __It must not use WMI__ because its usage can be restricted to admin-only users.

- Last but not least, it must be compatible with __PowerShell Version 2__. 


## Addressing all the constraints...

- __Third-party tools__

I have no merit, I reused some of the code made by [@harmj0y](https://twitter.com/harmj0y) and [@mattifestation](https://twitter.com/mattifestation). Indeed, PowerUp has a very powerfull function called `Get-ModifiablePath` which checks the ACL of a given file path to see if the current user has write permissions on the file or folder. I modified this function a bit to avoid some false positives though. Before that a service command line argument such as `/svc`could be identified as a vulnerable path because it was interpreted as `C:\svc`. My other contribution is that I made a _registry-compatible_ version of this function (`Get-ModifiableRegistryPath`).

- __Windows built-in windows commands/tools__

When possible, I naturally replaced them with built-in PowerShell commands such as `Get-Process`. In other cases, such as `netstat.exe`, you won't get as much information as you would with basic PowerShell commands. For example, with PowerShell, TCP/UDP listeners can easily be listed but there is no easy way to get the associated Process ID. In this case, I had to invoke Windows API functions.

- __WMI__

You can get a looooot of information through WMI, that's great! But, if you face a properly hardened machine, the access to this interface will be restricted. So, I had to find workarounds. And here comes the __Registry__! Common checks are based on some registry keys but it has a lot more to offer. The best example is services. You can get all the information you need about every single service (except their current state obviously) simply by browsing the registry. This is a huge advantage compared to `sc.exe` or `Get-Service` which depend on the access to the __Service Control Manager__. 

- __PowerShellv2 support__

This wasn't that easy because newer version of PowerShell have very convenient functions or options. For example, the `Get-LocalGroup`function doesn't exist and `Get-ChildItem` doesn't have the `-Depth` option in PowerShellv2. So, you have to work your way around each one of these small but time-consuming issues. 

## Implementing additional checks 

Custom vulnerability checks can now be included dynamically. It's particularly interesting for blue teams if you want to use this script as a way to automatically assess the security of one or more machines.

### Procedure

1. Create the folder Ì€`PrivescCheckPlugins` in the same location as the the script `PrivescCheck.ps1`.

2. Create a CSV file `PrivescCheckPlugins.csv` in the folder `PrivescCheckPlugins`.

The directory structure should now look like this:

```txt
.
|__ PrivescCheck.ps1
|__ PrivescCheckPlugins\
    |__ Custom.ps1
    |__ PrivescCheckPlugins.csv
```

3. Populate the `PrivescCheckPlugins.csv` using the following structure:

```csv
"Id", "File", "Command", "Params", "Category", "DisplayName", "Type", "Note", "Format", "Extended"
"TEST_ID", "Custom.ps1", "Invoke-SomeCheck", "", "MyCategory", "Test Title", "Vuln", "Description of the test", "List", False
```

4. Implement your check (e.g.: `Invoke-SomeCheck`) in a dedicated script (e.g.: `Custom.ps1`)

If a check returns at least one result, it will be interpreted as a vulnerability finding. Therefore, it the check is compliant, nothing shall be returned. 

### Example

Let's say that we want to check whether LLMNR is disabled.

1. Edit the file `.\PrivescCheckPlugins\PrivescCheckPlugins.csv` like so:

```csv
"Id", "File", "Command", "Params", "Category", "DisplayName", "Type", "Note", "Format", "Extended"
"HARDEN_LLMNR", "MyCustomChecks.ps1", "Invoke-LlmnrCheck", "", "Hardening", "LLMNR configuration", "Vuln", "LLNMR should be completely disabled to prevent domain name spoofing and NetNTLM relaying attacks on the local network.", False
```

2. Create the script `.\PrivescCheckPlugins\MyCustomChecks.ps1` and implement `Invoke-LlmnrCheck`.

```powershell
function Invoke-LlmnrCheck {

    [CmdletBinding()] param ()

    $RegistryKeyPath = "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient"
    $RegistryValue = "EnableMulticast"

    $Result = Get-Item -Path "Registry::$RegistryKeyPath" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -ErrorVariable ErrorGetItem 
    if (-not $ErrorGetItem) {

        $Result = Get-ItemProperty -Path "Registry::$RegistryKeyPath" | Select-Object -ExpandProperty $RegistryValue -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -ErrorVariable ErrorGetItemProperty
        if (-not $ErrorGetItemProperty) {

            if ($Result -eq 0) {
                $Compliant = $True
                $Message = "LLMNR is disabled"
            } else {
                $Compliant = $False
                $Message = "LLMNR is enabled" 
            }
            
        } else {
            $Compliant = $False 
            $Message = "ERROR: Cannot find registry value"
        }

    } else {
        $Compliant = $False 
        $Message = "ERROR: Cannot find registry key"
    }

    if (-not $Compliant) {
        $CheckResult = New-Object -TypeName PSObject
        $CheckResult | Add-Member -MemberType "NoteProperty" -Name "Path" -Value $RegistryKeyPath
        $CheckResult | Add-Member -MemberType "NoteProperty" -Name "Value" -Value $RegistryValue
        $CheckResult | Add-Member -MemberType "NoteProperty" -Name "Data" -Value $Result
        $CheckResult | Add-Member -MemberType "NoteProperty" -Name "Description" -Value $($Message)
        $CheckResult
    }
}
```

3. Run the `PivescCheck.ps1` script without specifying any additional argument. If it finds the file `.\PrivescCheckPlugins\PrivescCheckPlugins.csv`, the custom checks will automatically be loaded and executed.
